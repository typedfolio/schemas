# Overview

This repository contains the specification of all Typedfolio schemas grouped by use-cases, such as personal profile, project profile, working group and so on. The schemas are specified in the IETF RFC 8610 [Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8610/).

See CDDL conversion utilities from Carsten Borman: [https://github.com/cabo/cddlc](https://github.com/cabo/cddlc). There is also a parser, generator and validator for CDDL as a Ruby gem at [https://rubygems.org/gems/cddl/](https://rubygems.org/gems/cddl/).

**Status (as of February 2024)**: CDDL specifications may contain errors and are incomplete. This is work-in-progress.
